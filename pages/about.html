                        <p>I'm Usman Oshodi, a front-end developer with a focus on building performant, 
                            accessible, and responsive user interfaces. I work primarily with HTML
                            , CSS, and JavaScript, and I have experience with React, Tailwind CSS,
                            NextJS, and Supabase for backend services.
                            I enjoy turning design ideas into interactive UI's and learning new web technologies to improve user experience.</p>

                                Beyond code, I enjoy collaborating with designers and back-end developers to ship delightful products.
